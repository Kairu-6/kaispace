**Failure is not a permanent destination; it is a temporary pitstop for those willing to learn.**

# The Lowest Point: Form 1 to Form 3 My secondary school journey started on a very shaky ground. From Form 1 to Form 3, I was consistently ranked in the bottom 10 of my entire batch during exams. I remember the feeling of looking at the results board and seeing my name at the very end. I felt invisible, not just to the teachers, but to my peers as well. I lacked a sense of purpose and direction. I believed that some people were just born "smart" and I wasn't one of them. This mindset was my biggest hurdle. I attended classes at SMAPK, but I was physically present and mentally elsewhere. My grades reflected this lack of engagement—it was a sea of mediocre results that made me feel like my future was already decided.

## The realization hit me when I entered Form 4. I looked at the path ahead and realized that the SPM was looming. I didn't want to be the person who just "got through" school; I wanted to be someone who excelled. I decided to strip away my old habits. I realized that the "smart kids" weren't using magic—they were using better systems. I started researching how the brain actually learns. I moved away from passive reading and highlighting, which gave me a false sense of security, and moved toward ** Active Recall ** and ** Spaced Repetition **. I stopped being a passive consumer of information and became an active participant in my education.

### Developing the 10A+ Strategy My strategy became clinical. I broke down every subject into its core components. For Biology, I used mental mapping to connect complex systems. For Add Math, I did thousands of practice questions until the patterns became second nature. I spent my mornings from 4 AM to 6 AM in deep study when the hostel was quiet.

- I prioritized understanding the "why" before the "how." 
- I taught my friends topics I was struggling with, as teaching is the best way to learn. 
- I maintained a strict schedule that balanced rest with intense focus.

#### The Result When the SPM results were finally released, I couldn't believe my eyes. 10A+. The student who was once in the bottom 10 had reached the very top. This journey taught me that intelligence is plastic—it can be shaped and grown through sheer discipline and the right techniques. If you are struggling right now, know that your current rank does not define your potential.
